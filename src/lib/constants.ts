The company was dedicated to scanning the entire old city of Tbilisi to create the most realistic 3D model possible. This project aimed to enable virtual reality tours of historic Tbilisi. My responsibility was to go to specific locations in old Tbilisi, which could be a particular house or any significant site, and capture photographs from all possible angles. These photos were then uploaded into the 3D scanning software, RealityCapture, to create a 3D scan of the area. As a 3D modeler, I would then refine and enhance the scan to make it as realistic as possible. Additionally, I would create textures in Substance Painter to ensure high-quality, lifelike details.",

At HOLLOSEUM, a subsidiary of Sarke Studio was a Projection mapping company, we brought to life the magnificent paintings of old masters such as Pirosmani, Van Gogh, and others. This involved animating 2D paintings and narrating their stories on a grand stage. HOLLOSEUM was a museum equipped with numerous projectors, allowing visitors to view our animations directly.\n\nI served as the lead animator, but my responsibilities extended beyond animation. To bring the paintings to life, I first had to perform retouching in Photoshop to separate the elements of the paintings into individual layers. I also needed to fill in any empty spaces, painting in the same style as the original artwork so that viewers couldn't detect any changes. This required not only animation skills but also artistic ability. Finally, I composited everything together in After Effects to create the final animations.",
